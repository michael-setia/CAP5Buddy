## Project: Cap 5.0 Buddy

Cap 5.0 Buddy - Cap 5.0 Buddy helps SoC students to keep track of their module details efficiently. It helps them to centralize key module details and follows their study progress through a CLI that optimizes the management of important module details.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to create and add modules into the list.
  * What it does: allows the user to store modules into the program with the given information.
  * Highlights: This enhancement allows more complicated and advanced commands to be executed with the introduction of the different extensions. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation was not very difficult as this is just the basic block for future functions.
  * Credits: We refactored the original AB3's code to change from a AddPerson to a AddModule.
