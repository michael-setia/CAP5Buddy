## **Design**

### Architecture

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

### OverAll components
<img src="images/overallUML.png" width="500px">

This is the overall design of our product. As we are using **GUI to help to display the information** and mainly focuses on
using **CLI to take in the required commands**, thus the product consists of **6 main major components**. The product starts 
from the Launcher classes, that initiates based on our pre-set settings and then activates the MainApp class
the will run the GUI with these settings. MainApp will also start the _brain_ and -muscles_ of the program, which are the Logic, Storage,
Model and Ui components. 

The role of the **Logic** component is to act as the _brain_ of the program, where all the parsing of information will be done, and the 
execution of the commands will be carried out.

The role of the **Storage** component is to represent the _memory_ of the program, where the storing and tracking of the different items happens.
These items are saving locally in a json file, which can be imported and exported easily.

The role of the **Model** component is to represent all the items and their behaviours. Contains all the item classes and their support classes.

The role of the **Ui** component is to handle all the User interface related instructions, which includes the loading of GUI components, the updating
of these components and displaying the changes.
