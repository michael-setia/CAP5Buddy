## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a number of classes
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: 
* Users can keep track of all module details efficiently.
* Centralize key module details.
* Keep track of study progress effectively.
* Everything can be done in a single app.

### Use cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `CAP5BUDDY` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

**User case: Add a new Module**

**MSS**

1. User wants to add a new module to track.
2. User enters the add module command.
`add [module name/code] [zoom link]`
3. CAP5BUDDY adds the module into storage and display the success message.

*{More to be added}*

**Use case: Delete a module**

**MSS**

1. User requests to show all the existing modules.
2. CAP5BUDDY displays a list of the modules.
3. User requests to delete a specific module from the list.
4. CAP5BUDDY deletes that module from the list.

**Extensions**
* 2a. The list is empty.

  Use case ends here.

* 3a. The given index is invalid or does not exist.

  * 3a1. CAP5BUDDY displays an error message.

    Use case resumes at step 2.

**Use case: Edit a module**

**MSS**

1. User requests to show all the existing modules.
2. CAP5BUDDY displays all the modules in a list.
3. User requests to edit a specific module from the list.
4. User enters the new information for that module.
5. CAP5BUDDY overwrites the existing information of that module.

**Extensions**
* 2a. The list is empty.

  Use case ends here.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

1. _{ more test cases …​ }_

### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

1. _{ more test cases …​ }_

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. _{explain how to simulate a missing/corrupted file, and the expected behavior}_
